    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Bounce houses, inflatable games, jump hoses, inflatable slides and inflatable attractions are all large inflatable games made for interactive entertainment. Intended for children and adults bounces houses are made of PVC or other durable materials such as nylon or vinyl that when look like a house or castle when inflated. Party Rental companies deliver bounce houses to birthday parties, festivals, fairs and other events. The companies have industrial-grade blowers that fill the large structures with air to make them inflatable. A common size for a bounce house might be 15 feet by 15 feet by 13 feet and some can be 40 x 40! Bounce houses often have a flat, inflatable bottom pad and inflatable walls so that kids can jump and bounce without being hurt, along with a netting door and windows so that kids can see out and adults can see in. Bounce houses are suitable for both indoor or outdoor events, depending on the venue. For large events, inflatable rental companies often have a staff member who stays with the structure to monitor safety and keep it properly inflated. Prime Time delivers, sets up and staffs our inflatable bounce houses and is fully insured. There are also wet/dry bounce houses with slides that you can hook up to a hose on hot summer days. A bounce house can be a fantastic addition to a party with kids, keeping them both entertained and contained."
